As electric vehicle (EV) adoption surges, urban planners need to anticipate infrastructure needs—especially charging stations. Inadequate planning can lead to bottlenecks, impacting user satisfaction and hindering sustainability goals.

**Problem Statement:** Using the electric vehicle dataset (which includes information on EV populations, vehicle types, and possibly historical charging usage), create a model to forecast future EV adoption. For example, predict the number of electric vehicles in upcoming years based on the trends in the data.

**Goal:** Build a regression model that forecasts future EV adoption demand based on historical trends in EV growth, types of vehicles, and regional data.

**Dataset:** This dataset shows the number of vehicles that were registered by Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) each month. The data is separated by county for passenger vehicles and trucks.

- **Date:** Counts of registered vehicles are taken on the last day of each month, ranging from **2017-01-31 to 2024-02-29**.

- **County:** The geographic region within Washington State where a vehicle owner resides. All vehicles are registered in Washington.

- **State:** The geographic region of the country associated with the record. Some addresses may belong to states other than Washington.

- **Vehicle Primary Use:** Describes the primary intended use of the vehicle. (Passenger – **83%**, Truck – **17%**)

- **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):** The count of vehicles propelled solely by energy derived from an onboard electric battery.

- **Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):** The count of vehicles propelled partially by energy from an onboard electric battery.

- **Electric Vehicle (EV) Total:** The sum of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

- **Non-Electric Vehicle Total:** The count of vehicles that are not electric.

- **Total Vehicles:** All powered vehicles registered in the county, including electric and non-electric vehicles.

- **Percent Electric Vehicles:** The percentage of electric vehicles compared to the total number of vehicles.
